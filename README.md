AI Quiz Application
This is a full-stack AI Quiz application designed to provide users with a quiz experience. It consists of two main parts:

Frontend (React.js): The user interface for interacting with the quiz.

Backend (Node.js + Express): The server that handles API requests and serves the quiz data.

The project demonstrates how to build a basic quiz system with AI-generated questions. It supports interactive quiz-taking with multiple-choice questions and backend integration to generate quizzes dynamically.
